==================================================================
     quick-and-dirty user's guide for AMIGA's Web Classifier
 (the code uses the Cweb and hence the present naming convention)
==================================================================


WARNING: as no proper user's guide exists (yet), we strongly recommend to register as a user to alexander.knebe@uam.es who will also be more than ahppy to help with all possible problems...

REMARK: the mode of operation is in fact identical to AMIGA's Halo Finder (AHF) which is described in http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF/files/AHF.pdf (all DEFINEFLAGS and features are present in Cweb too, and should be used in the same way.)


Cweb
====

- a code calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor in every grid cells

- check http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3367 for the physical details (paper can also be found inside documentation/)

- check AHF's users-guide.pdf (http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF/files/AHF.pdf) for
	- how to compile the code and 
	- how to feed your favourite simulation into it.

- while the whole AMR infrastructure is present, at the moment only regular grids are supported


just some random notes that might help to get the code up-and-running quickly:

Makefile.config:
----------------
- adjust in the same way as you would adjust AHF, primarily using
	-DMULTIMASS	if there are particles with different masses in your simulation
	-DGAS_PARTICLES	if there are gas and/or star particles in your simulation
- DMfocus will ignore all gas and star particles and only keep (all) DM particles for the analysis

- DWRITE_GRIDDATA will write a file (with meaningful name) that contains all the density fields *before* any smoothing; this file will be written into the same place as the input file (irrespective of what you put as outfile_prefix)
- DREAD_GRIDDATA will read exactly that file in again (no need to change the ic_filename!), speeding up any analysis  based upon the same density fields (e.g. different smoothing); the file is expected to be found where ic_filename is located
- GENERAL SUGGESTION: compile two Cweb version, i.e. Cweb_WRITEGRIDATA and Cweb_READGRIDDATA
- the WRITE_ASCII option only writes Vweb data, even if you compiled the code with, for instance, PWEB

- you can make the following codes:
	$ make Cweb
	$ make Cweb2ascii   -> should be obsolete as read_Cweb.py/plot_Cweb.py should be the favourite choice for post-processing
	$ make Cwebhalos

  where Cweb is the main code, Cweb2ascii converts the binary output of Cweb to ASCII, Cwebhalos correlates the output of Cweb to AHF's *_halos file


Cweb.input-example:
-------------------
- Lgrid is the grid used for the calculation of all fields, it needs to be a power of 2 because of the FFTs involved in the smoothing (if you do not smooth, it can be any number)

- Rsmooth will smooth the density fields on this scale as given in [Mpc/h]; but note, if that scale is smaller than twice the grid spacing, the scaling will not take place as it is meaningless


- CAREFULLY check the units you provide for your simulation snapshot file (cf. the block [GADGET], [TIPSY], whatever)


src/define.h:
-------------
- all DEFINEFLAGS can also be switched on here, but best to leave the 'standard' stuff alone


analysis/plot_Cweb.py
---------------------
This is likely the most important code as everyone uses Python these days. This snippet shows you how to read either a Cweb-ascii or (even better!) a Cweb binary file and extract relevant information/data from it.



analysis/Cweb2ascii.c:
----------------------
This is the old school way to deal with the binary files written by the Cweb code. You can use it as a converter to an ASCII file (for a selected list of properties) or as a starting point for your own C post-processing code.

either...

- activate WRITE_FULL_SET to get a full ASCII dump of Cweb's binary output

or

- define in write_Cweb() what quantities you are interested in 


analysis/Cwebhalos.c:
---------------------
- generates a file that lists for every halo which kind of cell it lies in 
- here lambda_threshold is in fact the important quantity to classify the cosmic web
- ahf2Cweb is the conversion factor to go from AHF's length units to Cweb units


====>
WHILE Cweb COULD BE USED AS A BLACK BOX, THE POST-PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS OF ITS OUTPUT FILES REQUIRE THE USER TO LOOK INTO Cweb2ascii.c and Cwebhalos.c!
